title: 'The current state of job search in 2024'

21 day later, after about 50 applications and only 1(one) ongoing interview process, I have to conclude that the job search has changed quite a lot since 2022. 
What stopped working:
* LinkedIn jobs - to be honest I've never used this before, but I thought I would get at least some interviews or feedback. Out of about 35 applications, there's only silence, as well as several automatic rejections.
* Resume that is good enough - I've used the same simple resume template for 3 previous job searches. Now though, resume has to be ATS(Applicant tracking system)-friendly. I recommend https://www.vmock.com/ for resume review.
* AI,AI,AI - bots are everywhere now. Positions are getting 100+ applications in the matter of hours. I can only imagine how bad it is for the HR department, I assume they are using AI to filter it as well :)

What worked:
* Networking&references - the only interview I've gotten so far was through a friend's reference.
* Talking to recruiters - reaching out directly to recruiters, I was able to get better feedback on my resume, as well as some more potential interviews in the near future.

For those who had to find a new job recently, what worked for you? I am curious to hear your thoughts while I'm working on my own AI bot to apply for jobs and tailor resumes.
